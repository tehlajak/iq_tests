The second shape is an ordered gradient from light to dark based on column position: light gray, darker gray, and darkest gray, and the shapes are circles, squares and diamonds. The last two rows are the light gray circle above the dark gray triangle, so the next element should be a square above a diamond. The coloring that fits is the square should be the darkest gray and the diamond should be light gray. The correct answer is: C\"\n}",
