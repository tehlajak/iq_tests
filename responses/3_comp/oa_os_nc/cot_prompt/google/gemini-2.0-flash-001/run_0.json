In the second, you have square, circle and square. In the third, you have square, circle and triangle. All the shapes in each row are different. Therefore, the last one should be a diamond. Now for the shades. The first column is black, gray, light gray. The second column is dark gray, medium gray and light gray. The third column is gray, light gray. So the shade for the last one should be dark gray. The shade sequence (or reverse that) is the same order of the first column and second column, and last row. Hence the correct shape is: C.\"\n}",
