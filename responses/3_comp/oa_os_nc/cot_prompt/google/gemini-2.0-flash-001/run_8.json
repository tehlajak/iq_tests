In the first column, the top shape is dark, the middle shape is grey, and the bottom shape is light. In the second column, the top shape is grey, the middle shape is dark, and the bottom shape is grey. The third column should have the top shape light, the middle shape grey, and on the bottom the shape dark. Shapes are also progressing diagonally. From left to right the shapes are a diamond, square and a circle. The diamond turns to square, the square turns to a circle, the circle turns into a triangle, then diamond, then square. Therefore this means that the shape must be a diamond. Given that it must also be the color black, there are two possible answer choices (C, D). Since the diamonds in the matrix are rotated counterclockwise, C is the only possible answer choice. \\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
