The top shapes in each column are: hexagon, circle, square; hexagon, square, pentagon; circle, square, hexagon. This suggests the sides increase from top to bottom. The bottom shapes in each column are: hexagon, triangle, pentagon; hexagon, triangle, circle; square, pentagon. In the 3rd column, the bottom shape of the incomplete grid is hexagon. The shapes in the boxes below the grid (A to H) are either variations of hexagon or triangle, colored or uncolored; the color shades range from light to dark. We need a hexagon. Consequently, choices B, D, E, and H can be ruled out. Choices A, and F are light and are not feasible. Option G is too dark. Thus option C is the most likely solution.\\nTherefore the figure resembles a hexagon with the correct color. This correlates with the given pattern.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
