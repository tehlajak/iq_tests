Looking at the final column, we have a square, a hexagon, and a pentagon. This suggests a pattern where shapes decrease the number of sides. On the shading pattern, the shades appear to alternate between dark and light shapes following the rows. Given the last row has the white circle shape, a medium shaded pentagon, it follows that the missing shape must be a dark shaded Hexagon to match both the shade and the number of sides pattern. \\n\\nTherefore, I choose to fill the missing cell with a dark-shaded hexagon. Options A, B, D, E, and F can be ruled out immediately because they don't contain a suitable hexagon as required. Options G and H do not match the dark shaded area as it is needed here. That means option C must fit with the logic defined. \\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
