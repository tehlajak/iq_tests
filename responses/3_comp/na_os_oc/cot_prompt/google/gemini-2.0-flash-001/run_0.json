For example, a Hexagon(6 sides) becomes a pentagon(5 sides) in the next row. Going down the last column, the top is a square(4 sides) which becomes a pentagon with a color change on the second row, so the last cell should either be a shape with 3 sides, or a circle of the same color as the square(grey shade). The next shape in the last column is a triangle with a gray shade. \\nTherefore, option C fits better, since option A is also hexagon which doesn't match the series reduction.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
