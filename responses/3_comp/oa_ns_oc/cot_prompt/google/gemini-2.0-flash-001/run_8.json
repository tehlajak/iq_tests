The shapes in the grid change shades from left to right (white, gray, black) and cycle through shapes row by row (starting with a hexagon, then diamond, etc.). The dot on top alternates between white/black. Given the pattern, the last shape should have a black dot on top of a gray circle, so the correct answer is D.\\n\"\n}",
