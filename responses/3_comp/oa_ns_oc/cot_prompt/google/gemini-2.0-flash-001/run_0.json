We should note that the bottom left and middle row elements are reflected on the bottom row by shape and shade. So the cross in the bottom right box, should have a reflected shadow and a reflected shape to complete it.\\n\\nThe shapes in the bottom row contain circles. These all have a reflected shape to the corresponding shape in the original grid and reflection in shading.\\nWe are looking for a rotated diamond as this is the shape above and it must be the darkest possible grey. D matches this. \\nTherefore, D is the most likely match.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: D\"\n}",
