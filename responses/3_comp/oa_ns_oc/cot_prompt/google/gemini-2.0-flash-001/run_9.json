Analyzing the columns: in the first column, the shapes are a hexagon, a diamond, a hexagon, a circle, and a diamond; the shapes alternate between polygons (hexagon, diamond, hexagon) and lines (circle); shade alternates with gray, none, solid, none, and then gray. Columns two and three do something similar. The shape at the top alternates positions between each column. Since each row is consistent until the last entry, the next step is to focus on the last row. The last row consists of a triangle and then a diamond. The shade on each entry changes from gray to blank but the shapes vary. Considering that the shape above the final cell is diamond shaped and gray, the last cell needs to be non-shaded with another shape with additional lines. So, the final entry is an outline shape with lines on top of an gray, shaded sphere in a diamond shape. Therefore, options B, D, E, and F are immediately out because of a solid shade atop a sphere. Additionally, G and H are also eliminated, as there must not be a dot on top as row three contains no additional shapes/shades above the shape. Thus, option A is the correct answer, based upon shades and the additional line.\"\n}",
