The second row has a dark pentagon, small pentagon, and medium gray pentagon, showing size variations with a consistent pattern of increase. The third row has a large pentagon, small pentagon, and different symbol (diamond), showing more consistent size than shape. The last row is incomplete with two gray pentagons, suggesting a visual and size pattern repeats across. The middle column provides a clue for maintaining the small size (since it's consistently small across rows 2, 3, and 4). Eliminating options, only options F and H fit the pattern and aesthetics. Option B mirrors the consistent pattern of gray in shapes: the same small pentagon and follows required size, making it the logical choice to maintain the overall balance and consistency observed across rows and columns.
