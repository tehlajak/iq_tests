In the row, the first and third cell have shapes that alternate from round, angle, and number of sides. The second row contains different shapes, specifically, the number of sides. Based on this logic: I noticed is when it comes to shape on each row, the 1st column shape is a bigger and darker tone versus the 2nd and 3rd. I also noticed that the other shapes, except pentagon that alternates, have shape and tones versus shapes in the 2nd and 3rd column. Based on this observation and logic process, I have eliminated all options that did not follow this pattern. The correct answer is: C\"\n}",
