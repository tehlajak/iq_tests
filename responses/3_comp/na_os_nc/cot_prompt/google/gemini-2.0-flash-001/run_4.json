Looking at the columns, observe change in shading from light gray, to light to dark. Also, shapes are gradually becoming simpler (circle to pentagon), so, the pentagon gradually becomes a triangle at the end. Row 4 is Square -> Square with sides rotated -> Square, Row 5 is Pentagon-> Pentagon -> Triangle. This indicates there's a gradual change in shading from left to right for Square Shape , and number of vertices in bottom figure reducing from 5 to 3 at the far right. Shading of top Square Shape changes from Light -> light to dark -> Dark from left to right.. In Row 5, number vertices for bottom shape reduces from 5 to vertices 3. Observing the shading pattern, this shape most closely resembles C, as the shading transitions towards the darker shade from light to dark.\"\n}",
