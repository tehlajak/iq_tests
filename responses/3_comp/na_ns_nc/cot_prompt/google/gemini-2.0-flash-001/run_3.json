The third column has shape with 4 sides, then again 4 sides - which means that the missing shape should have 4 sides. The shades alternating across the rows is dark, gray, gray and the shades alternating across the column are gray, gray, dark. Therefore, the missing shape needs to have 4 sides and it needs to be a dark shape.\\nUsing these two rules, you can eliminate options (A, B, C, E, F, G, H), leaving only option D as the correct answer.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: D\"\n}",
