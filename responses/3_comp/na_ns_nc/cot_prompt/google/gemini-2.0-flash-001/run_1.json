The number of sides in the shape also increases along columns from top to bottom: 6, 5, 4. Therefore, using this pattern, the last shape must be Diamond and light. Options A, D, E and H and therefore are incorrect. Also the shape at bottom should only have four sides. Therefore option B is the correct option.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: B\"\n}",

Looking at the first two rows and first two columns of the given pattern, the top shape and the shape right below it have the same gray shading, the bottom shape has the opposite shading. Taking the two trends together, the missing element has to be a diamond shape in a light grey shade, with a smaller diamond shape the same light grey one space below it.
