The fourth has 3,3,3 sides and the fifth row has 5, 5, and the only possible number of sides is 4 (a diamond). In terms of shading, the column starts with dark to lighter, with a repeated pattern after that to look dark to light. The last row alternates light to dark. Size on the last row is small diamond in the next to last position. So need a light shaded diamond on top and some sort of small shape in the bottom.
