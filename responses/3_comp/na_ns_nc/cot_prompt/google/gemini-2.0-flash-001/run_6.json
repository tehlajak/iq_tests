From left to right and top to bottom, the sides are decreasing for each shape (starting with a hexagon, then a pentagon, then a square).\\n2. **Color Shift**: The color changes from dark to light from bottom to top. And from left to right as well. \\n3. Considering all that, the missing shape should be a slightly shaded pentagon, following the sides number rule.\\n\\nNow, let's check through our options:\\n*   Options A, D, E, and H are darker than the rest of the shapes in the area being considered. Therefore, these are definitely wrong.\\n*   Options B and F are a rhomboid instead of a pentagon, therefore, these are wrong as well.\\n*   Option G has the wrong shape after the pentagon. Thus, it is wrong too.\\nThe right answer is the one that contains a relatively shaded pentagon.\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
