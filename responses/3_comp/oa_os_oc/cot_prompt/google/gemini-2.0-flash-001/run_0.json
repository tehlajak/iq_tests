The previous row has small circle and pentagon, which implies we need a shaded triangle. The option A has triangle and hexagon, which is incorrect. The option H has triangle and hexagon, which is also wrong. The option E has triangle and circle instead of the needed triangle and hexagon. Thus by elimination, the only matching option that would make the row and column patterns right is \u2018A\u2019.\\nSince there is a shape sequence such as circle, pentagon and triangle on each rows. The last column has triangles, so the next shape will have two of them. The triangle on the right must alternate shades. Thus the triangle at the X must be on shades. Looking downward from the X will contain the next hexagon. The only correct completion is \u2018A\u2019.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: A\"\n}",
