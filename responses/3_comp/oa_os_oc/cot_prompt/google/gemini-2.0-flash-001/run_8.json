The shape shading alternates between rows 1-2, 3-4. The bottom row provides the shape needed to complete the pattern in the column missing the last figure. Therefore a triangle filled with dark grey is the correct pattern to select, and a pentagon is placed below it to follow the correct sequence. \\n\\nThe correct answer is: A\"\n}",

The second row shows identical shapes but heavily shaded. The third row shows the original shape, circle and pentagon and therefore, the third shape must be identical to the first row, so must be a triangle. Looking at column 1, from the second shape onwards, there is a circle followed by a circle with a stronger shade, therefore the next shape is a circle with a weak shade. Similarly, column 2 shows a pentagon, followed by a pentagon with more shade implying the third shape is a pentagon with weak shade. Therefore, from this evidence, in all of the shapes, the intensity of the shading alternates. The original shape (1) has a light shade, the first shape (2) has a dark shade, and the second shape (3) must have a light shade. This means a triangle will be lightly shaded so, it needs to have a lightly shaded shade. Option A has a lightly shaded triangle.\"\n}",
