Therefore the next triangle must be black.\\n\\nConsidering the color and shape characteristics of the third columns, the correct answer is triangle and black.\\n\\n'A' is the best fit of the shapes. Options B, D, E, F are not triangle. Options C, G, H are not the shape and correct order of the colors.\\nTherefor option A is the most appropiate\\n\\nThe correct answer is: A\"\n}",
