The second shape is derived from the first one by a transformation. The transformation includes the conversion of the first shape into a shape one geometrical order greater, but preserving the color, or converting it to medium grey if the shape is present in the pattern in black. In column 1, we see that the Pentagram shape is in light gray. Following this rule, we expect the cross location to hold a Diamon shape in light-gray color.\\n4) **Eliminate and Select:** Applying this selection rule, one can identify Shape C is clearly the suitable option.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
