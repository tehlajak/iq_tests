Firstly, in terms of shapes, each row contains the same family of shape, and this family of shape increments the number of sides by '1' in the next family of rows. Secondly, the shades appear to be decreasing going to the right and down. Therefore, the missing shape must follow the next shape in the family of shapes and follow the shading in the color scheme. \\n\\nAnalyzing the last row (the shapes are pentagon on the left and triangles in the middle) suggests that the shape in the missing box should be square.
