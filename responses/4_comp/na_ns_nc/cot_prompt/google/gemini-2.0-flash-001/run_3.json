The sizes change from small, to smaller to larger. The shaded grey changes from dark to light to a medium shaded grey. \\n\\nBased on this pattern sequence, the missing shape is of a circle, is shaded dark, and appears to be the average size of the rest of shapes in the sequence. From the options, only shape D has all these characteristics.\\n\\nTherefore,\\n\\nThe correct answer is: D\"\n}",
