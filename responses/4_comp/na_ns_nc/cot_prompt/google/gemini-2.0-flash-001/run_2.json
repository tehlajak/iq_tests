Thus, for the missing space, we need a top shape that is a circle of medium dark and medium size. Looking at the options, options A, B, C, E, F, and G all have triangles, so those options are incorrect. Option D has the correct shape, but not the correct shade of grey and size, so after eliminating the options, option H is the correct answer. \\n\\nThe correct answer is: H\"\n}",
