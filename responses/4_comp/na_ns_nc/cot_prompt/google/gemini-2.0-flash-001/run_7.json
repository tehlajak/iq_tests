The first two shapes in the third row are dark, and the cycle ends with the shape being light gray. The fourth row also contains circles, with light gray, dark gray, and a larger version of this dark gray fill. The fifth row contains a shape fill with a similar color pattern as the third and fourth rows, so, light gray, dark gray. Thus, the last shape in the fifth row should be dark. Lastly, the final row has the same colors as the fifth row. The pattern for the last shape consists of a filled in circle. Thus, the right answer must be answer D.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: D\"\n}",
