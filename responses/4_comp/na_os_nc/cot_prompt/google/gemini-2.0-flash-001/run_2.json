Let's analyze the trend in each row: In the first row, the number of sides increase by one progressively. In the second row, each shape is similar but with shading from dark to light. In the third row, one shape is a polygon with shaded, and the other is a polygon without color. The first shape in row 3 has 5 sides, then 6 sides then should have four sides.
