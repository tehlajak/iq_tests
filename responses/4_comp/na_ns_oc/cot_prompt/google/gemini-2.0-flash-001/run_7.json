The same applies to the next two rows and the sizes gradually decrease. A hexagon in the top-left corner slowly changes into a triangle in the top right corner. And in the last row square changes to a pentagon. So, the shapes across the last row will continue the pattern and get larger.\\n2. Examine Columns: Shapes transform vertically with changes in color and form. In the first column, a shapes is growing and becomes a triangle as it traverses through the row, similarly in the second column a shapes changes from a dot into a Pentagon. Therefore, based on these patterns, following shapes is triangle\\n3. Determine Characteristics: The missing shape should be a triangle with gray outline.\\n4. Eliminate Options: Options A, B, D, F, G and H contain other shapes.\\n5. Select Correct Shape: Given the trends and eliminations, Option C is the only viable triangle shape, thus completing the pattern accurately.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
