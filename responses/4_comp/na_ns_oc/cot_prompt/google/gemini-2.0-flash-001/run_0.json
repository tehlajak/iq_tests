One can count the circle as having infinite number of sides.\\n4) Therefore, focusing on the missing element:\\n\\nIn the grid, we observe a pattern involving transformation and combination of shapes. The sequence progresses row by row, indicating that the color saturation as well as the number of sides of the shapes is correlated in some way. Consequently, the missing shape must incorporate aspects of the patterns that precede from the shapes occupying the top of the column.\\n\\nBased on the patterns mentioned above, the correct shape is a dark-shade square.\\n\\nTherefore, E is correct.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: E\"\n}",
