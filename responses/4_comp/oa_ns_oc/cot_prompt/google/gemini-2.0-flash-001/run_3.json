The top row consists of a pentagon, circle, pentagon; the second row, a pentagon, triangle, rectangle; the third row, a square, square, square; the fourth row, again square, pentagon, triangle; the fifth row, triangle, triangle, diamond. This suggests the new element has to be triangle type. In terms of shading, dark, light, dark would be the logic but it is not consistent. However, across columns, noting shape and shading is more consistant, with both being the same, thus, the new element has to be a dark triangle as well as the bottom part, which is a light shaded pentagon.\\nConsidering the options given, the shape that fits is C.\\nThus, 'The correct answer is: C'.\"\n}",
