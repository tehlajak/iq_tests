The first shape on the top row of the original image is a shape with 5 sides, the second with 5 sides as well and the third shape with 5 sides. In the second row the first value has 4 sides, same as the second and same as the third. the third raw is same as the second row. In the original image the first column we observe the first shape with 5 sides from 5, 4, 4, 3 ,4 and the shapes of second row, the number of sides are 5, 4, 4 ,3, 4 sides. the column is same from 5, 4, 4, 3, 4 sides. the last row is triangle and has 3 sides. Based on this information, the last shape needs to have 5 sides because it is continuation of shapes observed in the image\\n\\nAnalyzing the bottom options, we look for the shape that has 3 sides on the top and 5 sides on the bottom. The answers A to E have 3 sides/triangle shape on the top and answers E to H has 3 sides top.\\nAnalyzing possible answer and their sides , option: A, B and F, G 5 sides on bottom, but A, B , F, G has not filled color, Based on the colors from the left, the answer options: C, D, E, H can be possible. Color light matches most likely from left side shape analysis. \\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
