Then in the rows comes pentagon, square, hexagon. The number of sides goes from 5 to 4 to 6. The pattern again goes from a pentagon, square, to ?. Therefore the number of sides for the unknown shape (i.e., the final shape in row 3 should have 3 sides) will have number of sides of 3. So it should be a triangle. \\n2) The shade is light, then darker, then darkest. So the last element should have light shade and should be a triangle. \\n3) Thus the answer can be only A, C, G or H.\\n4) Shapes diamond, hexagon, diamond, hexagon are in columns. Thus we should have a column pattern as diamond, hexagon, diamond. Therefore after A, B comes the shape that should be like a diamond.\\n5) This shape will be both triangle and like a diamond. Therefore option C. corresponds to the shapes, triangle and a diamonf, thus completes this pattern.\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
