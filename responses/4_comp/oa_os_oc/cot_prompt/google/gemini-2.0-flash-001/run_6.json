Following this trend, each column includes a circle, a pentagon and a triangle. So we need the triangle in the last. \\n2) Color: Colors change in shades and follow a pattern. In the first column, the color goes from light to dark to light, in the subsequent column goes from light to dark to light again and in the last should go from light to dark to light too. Therefore, a darker triangle should be in the empty cell.\\n3) Size: Shapes go from a small size to regular size in the second shape. With that, we can choose the only shape that follows with the previous logic, 'C'.\\n\\nTherefore, the right shape to complete the pattern is 'C'.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
