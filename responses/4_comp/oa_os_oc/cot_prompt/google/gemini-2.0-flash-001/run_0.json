Each column also follows a pattern of change in shape from circle, square, circle, square, and pentagon. The pattern of color goes from light circle to medium pentagon to dark triangle, then same with squares, then same with circles and pentagons at the end. I am thus therefore looking for a dark triangle shape to continue that pattern into the third spot in the third row. The correct answer is: C\"\n}",
