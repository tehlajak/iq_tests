From top to bottom, a polygon increases its sides by one in each cell from top to bottom. Then, the shape returns to being a polygon; in this row, the number of sides of polygons increased from 4 to 6 from the first two cells. This implies the third cell should contain another polygon with one more side, which is 7. Furthermore, the shape alternates in its darkness level through the sequence, with the shape in the top leftmost cell being pale. Therefore, the only shape that fits is either C or H. However, the sequence is a pentagon on the last row. This implies that the final shape should be a heptagon, meaning the answer must be (C).\\n\"\n}",
