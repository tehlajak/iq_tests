The colors are also descending darkness.\\n3) The third row shows filled in shapes with decreasing number of sides, and descending darkness.\\n\\nGiven this pattern, the missing shape should be a pentagon, because the squares have 4 sides; in addition, it must be lightly shaded to complete the pattern of descending darkness. Therefore, the answer must be a lightly shaded pentagon.\\n\\nAnalyzing the options:\\n- Options A, B, E, F, and G can be eliminated, because the shape under this is an outline of a pentagon, the shapes are not pentagons, or not shaded.\\n- Option D is not an outline shape, and is also shaded.\\n- Option H is an outline shape but is very small.\\n- Option C is an outline shape, and is also not as small as H.\\n\\nConsidering this, the best fit for the pattern from the available options is C.\\n\\nThe correct answer is: C\"\n}",
