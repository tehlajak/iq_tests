The shapes are alternating square, pentagon, and hexagon. The square has four sides, the pentagon has five sides, and the hexagon has six sides. Looking down the rows, the square shape is repeated in columns 1, 4, and 7. The second component (below) shows the same pattern of increasing sides from 4, 5, to 6, following the same sequence as the first top component shapes. So the unknown shape on top of the grid will be a shape with 5 sides, i.e. pentagon, while the shape below that would also be a pentagon. The shade of the next shape is white, derived from a sequence of gray, dark gray and white. All together, the pentagon shape should be a pentagon with 5 sides colored with white. After reviewing the alternate options, the option that contains white pentagon is shape C.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\"\n}",
